# California High Speed Rail

- The California High Speed Rail is currently planned to follow the existing Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way through Communications Hill. See the "San Jose to Merced" on the [CA HSR website](https://hsr.ca.gov/high_speed_rail/project_sections/san_jose_merced.aspx) for more details.
- The section that affects Communications Hill is incorrectly referred to as "Monterey Corridor" in their documents (the [real Monterey Corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartan_Keyes,_San_Jose) is north of Seven Trees, east of Monterey Ave, and south of Spartan Keyes).
